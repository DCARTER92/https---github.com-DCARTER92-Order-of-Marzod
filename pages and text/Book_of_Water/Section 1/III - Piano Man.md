"There's no way you could play a C chord on that thing!" the pianist screams.
"You're one to talk, yours doesn't even have strings," the guitarist snaps back.
"Did you guys forget your bows?" the fiddler asks, confused.


Sounds ridiculous, right? All these musicians can play just fine, but they're so wrapped up in their specific instruments they forgot the basics. They all hit the same notes, they can play the same songs, but they can't see past the logistics of the instruments. Working with spirits is no different. There's always that one guy who says "no, no, you don't use that symbol, it's this one, and you're praying all wrong," and wouldn't you know it, itâ€™s always his own culture that's got it right, whether he's saying Latin is God's language or the path to Heaven is in proper pronunciation of Sanskrit. My answer is, well, aren't you lucky you were born into the one and only culture in the time and space of this whole planet that knew what the hell they were doing, while the thousand others are only fooling themselves? Never play the lottery, buddy, you used up all your luck already on that one move.


Now, there's something to be said for mastering a specific practice, but you only have so much bandwidth. Do you want to go broad, or deep? A one-man band can play any instrument, but he'll never be as good at any of them as someone who mastered just one thing. So start broad, the basics of anything all live near each other. If you learn the basics of the fiddle, you're also learning things that translate to the cello, you're cutting through the noise to find the general principles that show up everywhere. You can specialize later, once you've learned the difference between fluff and substance.


In spirit work, the substance comes down to some basic elements, notes you can play no matter what instrument you're working with. First, you get the spirit's attention, using time, place, rituals, or props. Second, show some respect, if you go around acting like a prick nobody wants to talk to you, alive or dead. Third, give up something of value to establish a bond, ancient cultures used food, but in a world where most of us have full fridges, that doesn't mean as much. Fourth, you can ask for something. The rest is just tradition that varies from one culture to the next, and it's not useless, exactly, but anything that follows the same tune should work fine. If you play Beethoven's Fifth note for note on a tissue box with rubber bands on it, what kind of prick is going to tell you you're doing it wrong?


The main thing that I think gets in the way is the spoken word. As humans, we rely on it, we build our whole lives around it, but everything that's alive has a spirit, and we're in the minority as far as having complex vocal communication. That's clearly not how spirits talk. We're jabbering away, skipping the focus and connection that would actually help us along here, and the spirit may not even realize we're trying to say anything. So is it body language, then? That's how animals communicate, but you're going to have a hard time reading body language from something that has no body.


The key here is in the nature of Marzod, everything is one, but imagines itself different. All you need to do is recognize that, while circumstances caused you to manifest differently, you and the other spirit are the same thing. You're waves in the ocean, so stop thinking like a wave, think like the ocean. The first step is to shut the hell up, and the second is to focus on your connection to the spirit or spirits, not run around distracted like a puppy chasing its tail. Third, when you feel like you've established communication, offer them something, and fourth, you can try to get them to do something for you. Do this often enough, the spirits will be listening for you, you'll get to know a few regulars. If you get a good handle on what you're doing, you'll be playing concerts for a packed house, and the spirits will be yelling for an encore.
