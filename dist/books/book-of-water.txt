I want to tell you all how I came to be here today, writing this book. For most of my life, I was an Atheist. I never was all that solid with God, because when I was around 3 or 4, I convinced myself my Dad was going to Hell. He drank, smoke, cussed, and I didn't have a real firm grip on the difference between breaking rules and sinning, so I pretty much considered it a done deal, that when he died he'd go to Hell, and I was bound and determined to go with him. I eventually grew out of that, just in time to discover the really early stages of social media that we had back in the early 2000s. I was about 13, and for those of you that don't know, the Internet is just packed full of Atheists. Now, it had never occurred to me to ask whether God was actually real in all my 13 years, but it turned out every time I got in an argument with somebody about which side made more sense, I'd get my argument ripped to shreds and just feel like an absolute fool.
