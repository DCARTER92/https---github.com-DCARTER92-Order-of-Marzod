I want to start this by painting you two pictures: The America that was, and the America that is.

The average yearly income in the US today is around $60-$65,000 a year. That's about twenty times what it was in 1920.

The average home in 1920 cost about $3,500. Today, $500,000. If you're not too quick with numbers, that's $3,500 times 143. The average home price has been multiplied by 143, as opposed to the average salary multiplying times 20.

In 1920, a new car cost around $500, on average. Now it costs around $50,000. That's a 100-fold increase, opposed to that piddling little 20 for salary.

In 1920, a college tuition cost around $200 a year. Today, around $40,000, along with an interest rate designed to keep you trapped in the payments for the rest of your natural life, and I'm pretty sure they're looking into ways to make collections follow you into the grave too. A college education has been multiplied times 200. Two hundred, as opposed to twenty.

You were never meant to survive like this. This country has been hijacked by the rich, and I'm not talking about people that live in the good part of town and have two new cars and a boat, I'm talking about billionaires, CEOs, the people who really run the world. If you make $200k a year, relax, I'm not talking about you, because you're a lot closer to being broke than you are to being a billionaire. If you have a million dollars in assets, well, I'm happy for you, but you know the difference between a million dollars and a billion dollars? It's roughly a billion dollars. And you know what's the kicker? Most of us won't even see a million.

You know what really did it, was the Cold War. All of a sudden no nation could operate as its own thing, we had to bring other nations under our umbrella, save them from that big scary Red Menace, right? We did away with tariffs, heavy taxes on imported goods, all of a sudden it made sense for companies to have their products made in some rathole overseas for pennies, then ship them over here to sell to us for dollars, and pocket the difference. We were so afraid of the boys in red, we never stopped to think about the Green Menace, did we? We set big business owners up to take over the world, and they did it, they bought off all the politicians of every country that mattered, and they were set. This isn't a conspiracy, this is documented, verifiable, historical fact! You go look into it yourself, and then you tell me I'm wrong.

Your right to a stable future was stolen from you, priced so high you can only get it if you go into debt and spend your entire life working 60-hour weeks to get it! You just be a good little cog, do your job in the machine, and hope real hard that you don't get sick or hurt, because if you need any kind of serious medical treatment you can wave goodbye to anything you've got stocked up for the future, the debt you go into on that will bust your bank account flat and go digging through the bottom for more. It's these greedy bastards at the top, international bankers and businessmen, pricing us out of our lives, and the hell of it is they know how obvious it is. They know you can see it if you look, that's why they're always trying to get you to look somewhere else, try to get you to hate the white folks or the black ones or the gay ones, while they pick your pocket and charge you ten times what they charged your great-grandfather for the necessities of life! You stay mad at your neighbors or your boss or your landlord or whatever figurehead they've got installed in government, maybe you won't notice who's really causing all your grief. They think you're too stupid. So I'm here to ask, are you?

I'm assuming you said no, so what do we do about it? We pull out of their rigged game. Sit down and look at everything you spend money on, and ask yourself what you can do without. Every single thing that you need, that you can't do yourself or live without, is a brick in the wall of your prison. I'm telling you, the worst nightmare of these guys is that we'll all pull out of society, own land, grow crops, and barter with our neighbors for what we need. If enough of us did that, they'd feel their machine start to misfire, because the whole engine depends on all of us working all the damn time, and the population growing bigger each generation. Even just sitting still at its current output would kill it, it's like a pyramid scheme, if it stops growing it's dead.

You know the thing that helps them the most, aside from fighting amongst ourselves, is the entertainment industry. We're constantly distracted by movies, TV, games, music, social media, we don't put our whole brain into anything that matters. We're crack addicts always looking for our next hit so we don't have to think about how bad our lives are. The Roman writer Juvenal wrote "two things the people anxiously desire -- bread and circuses," and damned if we don't prove him right every single day. As long as we're kept entertained and fed, we're livestock, and we might notice how small the pen is, but we won't do anything about it, we'll keep right on serving our masters.

We have the power to make them sit up and take notice. All you have to do is stop buying so you can cut way down on working. Find a level where you're satisfied now and secure in the future, because you'll spend your whole life trying to jump one rung higher on the ladder otherwise. A king who conquers the world will die wishing for the Moon, we always want more. You have to figure out what "enough" looks like, get that, and sit down. Ask any workaholic on their deathbed, not a one of them wishes they spent more time at the office, bought a bigger house, had a newer car, it's time with family and friends they wish they had more of, but they never thought about it while they were alive, there was always just one last thing to get.

I want you to set aside time today, look at everything you have, and seriously ask, what can you do without? Plan yourself a life where you get rid of the things you don't truly need, and where you get the most practical versions of the things you have left. Maybe you don't need a new car, plenty of fine ones out there from 20 years ago. Maybe you don't need five different subscriptions to TV and music, maybe you're wasting a lot of electricity and water, I'm not going to write your budget for you, that's up to you. What I will tell you, as you go on and make your decision, is that every dollar you have to spend is a weakness for the bastards to exploit. It's another hour you have to work, it's another carrot for them to dangle so you'll keep being a good boy. You're tightening your own chain, and I won't tell you not to, but I want you to know what you're doing.

They want you distracted. They want you exhausted. They want you blind. But you're not any of those things. Not unless you choose to be.
