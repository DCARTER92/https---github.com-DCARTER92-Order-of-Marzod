## Section 1 - The Rebel Gods

### I. Prometheus

If you don't know who Prometheus is, well, I don't believe you, but okay. Let me tell you the story of the Greek god who by all rights should be the major deity of modern times, because he exemplifies the high points of Western morality, perfectly balancing individualism with societal obligation. But before I tell you about Prometheus, I need to tell you about the Titans, the Greek gods before the Greek gods.

The Titans were led by Cronus, who was the son of Ouranos, the primordial deity of the sky. Cronus overthrew his father and was the big man in charge for a while, and when Ouranos told him he'd one day be overthrown by his son just as he'd done to his father, he decided he wasn't having that and ate his children as they were born. Rhea, his sister and wife, was perhaps understandably upset by this, and when she had a sixth child, she gave Cronus a rock to eat instead. This sixth child was Zeus, who, sure enough, led a rebellion against Cronus and overthrew him.

Prometheus was part of Zeus's rebellion - one of the Titans who joined the Olympians to overthrow Cronus. By some accounts, Prometheus came to Earth after the war and made humans from clay. By others, he gave humans intelligence when his brother Epimetheus ran out of gifts to bestow.

Zeus demanded sacrifices from humans, but Prometheus tricked him into choosing the least valuable parts. In retaliation, Zeus took fire from humans. Prometheus stole it back from Mount Olympus, along with other gifts like agriculture and medicine. For this defiance, Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him to a mountain where an eagle ate his liver daily, until Heracles finally freed him.

### II. Lucifer

In a book on rebellious deities, leaving out the most famous one would just be weird. Would it surprise you at all to know Satan isn't evil? At least, not originally, not in the Bible, but we'll go into the Quran and classical literature after we've got that cleared up. Biblically, Satan appears as an accuser or prosecutor working for God rather than against Him.

The famous rebel angel Lucifer we know today mainly comes from John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667). The biblical evidence for a great heavenly rebellion before Genesis is scant at best. So why has this become the dominant narrative? Perhaps because every empire needs an enemy to unite against.

### III. Sun Wukong

The Monkey King is a central figure in Chinese mythology and Journey to the West. Born from stone, he gained incredible powers through Taoist practices but was rebellious by nature. After causing havoc in Heaven and defeating the Jade Emperor's armies, Buddha imprisoned him under a mountain for 500 years.

Sun Wukong became a central character in Journey to the West as protector of the monk Xuanzang. His story represents the rebellious spirit tamed through Buddhist discipline, yet still maintaining his heroic and mischievous nature.
