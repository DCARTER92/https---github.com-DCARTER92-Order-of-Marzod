Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, is a figure in Chinese mythology. He was born from a stone egg on a mountain, and the light from his eyes got the attention of the Jade Emperor. When his people reported back that it was only a stone monkey, he shrugged and went back to his work. The monkey found other monkeys to play with, and he grew up with them. They liked to play in a stream, and one day they decided that whoever could find the source of the stream would be their king. Well, I don't want to ruin the suspense, but the stone monkey did it.

One day one of his friends died, and he was so upset that he struck off into the world to find an immortal to teach him how to beat death. He found a village, but everyone was afraid of him, they'd never seen a stone monkey before, they ran away and the monkey wandered off into the woods. He heard a woodcutter whistling a tune, and he liked it so much he asked the woodcutter where he learned it, and found out he'd picked it up from an immortal in a temple in the forest. Well, the monkey followed the directions, found the temple, and met Puti Zushi, who refused to let him in at first, so the monkey camped outside the door for months. Puti Zushi was impressed with his determination and let him in, giving him the name Sun Wukong. Puti Zushi taught Sun Wukong a lot, and ended his education by telling him never to show off his skills, because people would want to learn, and this knowledge can't go to just anyone.

Sun Wukong knows he needs a weapon out in the world, but can't find one he likes. He eventually goes off to the palace of Ao Guang, a Dragon King, who tries to turn him away, but Sun Wukong barges in anyway. Ao Guang sees that Sun Wukong is too strong to be turned away, so he has his servants bring out weapons for the monkey to choose from. He finally picks the golden-banded staff, a two-ton stick that can be as big as a pillar or as small as a needle. He also gets a golden chainmail shirt, a phoenix feather cap, and cloudwalking boots.

Sun Wukong goes back home, and he expands his kingdom to include a lot more animals than just his monkey tribe. But Ao Guang doesn't like that this monkey just walked in and took his best weapon and armor, and sent Hell to collect his soul, which is a really useful connection to have, I can think of a few people I'd like to try it on. Sun Wukong scrubs his name out of the Book of Life and Death, along with the names of his friends, so he can't die and his soul can't be collected. Well, the Jade Emperor gets involved at this point, bringing his whole army down on Sun Wukong. But Sun Wukong has too good a weapon and too many soldiers, and he beats back the armies of Heaven.

The Jade Emperor finally decides to ally with Sun Wukong and make him a part of the empire to solve the problem. He's made Protector of Horses, and finds he's the stable boy for the cloud horses, so he frees them and returns to Earth, giving himself the title of Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, because he's not very good at subtlety. The Jade Emperor agrees he can use that title and makes him Guardian of the Heavenly Peach Garden, and Sun Wukong accepts, but finds he's just a gardener who's not invited to Heaven's social events. He gets drunk, steals a bunch of stuff, and runs back to Earth. The Jade Emperor gets his armies together to crush him, but it doesn't start off any better for him the second time around. Sun Wukong beats all the armies till Erlang Shen, the Emperor's nephew, fights him. They're evenly matched, there's a lot of shapeshifting, and finally Laozi throws his diamond jade ring at Sun Wukong from behind, which knocks him out, so that must have been one big damn ring.

Well, the Emperor tries several ways of killing Sun Wukong, but none of them work out, and eventually he's put in a forge to be melted down. This has the opposite effect, 49 days later he comes out, fully hardened and now able to see evil with his fiery golden eyes. He goes after the Emperor, who summons Buddha. Sun Wukong argues to Buddha that he should be the new Emperor, and Buddha says he can prove his power by sitting in his palm, then jumping out. Sun Wukong sees no problem with that, sits in Buddha's palm, jumps, runs, and cartwheels as far as he can, and reaches five giant pillars. He thinks this must be the end of the Universe, so he pees on one, as anyone would if they found the pillars at the end of the Universe, but they turn out to be Buddha's fingers. He turns his hand into a mountain, trapping Sun Wukong.

Well, he stays there for 500 years, until a priest, Tang Sanzang, comes by. He needs protection on his road trip, and Sun Wukong can kick Heaven's ass, so he's the obvious choice. He frees Sun Wukong on the condition that he helps the priest in return, and puts a golden circlet on the monkey's head that tightens when the priest chants, to keep him in line. They take a long trip to India and back to China, Sun Wukong learns about Buddhism, and in the end achieves Buddhahood. He gives up on being the new Emperor and settles for being the King of all Monkeys, which is probably a lot more fun anyway.

Rebel When You're Right: 1/3
He really created his own problems when he demanded equipment from Ao Guang, and once that was dealt with, should have just gone back to his monkeys and forgot about Heaven and the Emperor. But he got all caught up in his ego, and that got him into trouble.

No Dragons: 3/3
Sun Wukong doesn't accept limitations, he even sees the Jade Emperor's position as being up for debate.

Think it Through: 1/3
He's not a thinker, he'd rather hit things till they break. The fact that it works out for him so often doesn't make it the right answer.

The Mesopotamian Method: 3/3
He's always willing to work with others, he just gets cranky when he feels undervalued. Understandable, the Jade Emperor really was being a prick, but the right answer was to walk away, not pick a fight with God.

Total: 8/12
He lost a lot of points for choosing force over strategy, and for choosing ego over retreat. He didn't need these problems, he created them himself. The lesson here is to say "maybe I can, but should I?" He eventually made it to Heaven, but he had to learn he couldn't punch his way in.
