About 70,000 years ago, man migrated out of Africa, and woman must have gone along with him, or that would have been a short, lonely story. We weren't the first species to leave, several went before us, and I guess our ancestors figured it must have worked out for them when they didn't come back, so they followed. They packed up their tools, their stories, and their gods, and they hit the road, and the thing about the migration is it never stopped. We'd settle somewhere a while, then food would get scarce or a new threat would show up, and we'd pick up and move, taking our ideas and technology with us. Now, you couldn't predict where we'd end up if we headed away from the center of the European, African, Asian landmass, but if we headed toward the center, it was the Middle East every time. An idea or innovation might spread across its continent without crossing the Fertile Crescent, but in the days before ships, you weren't crossing to another continent without passing through the bottleneck of the Red, Black, and Mediterranean Seas, creating a situation where any idea worth having on those three continents, given enough time, would inevitably hit that area.


You ever wonder why those people were the earliest ones to invent agriculture, writing, math, big cities, pretty much all the defining traits of civilization? It's because they got exposed to everyone's ideas, all the time, and the Mayan, Aztec, and Incan cultures got that same boost over in the Americas. Any culture farther to the edges might have their own interesting and unique spin on whatever ideas came from their own continent, but they'd be missing most of what came from other continents, and that's why the Inuit, Scandinavians, South and West Africans, East Asians, and Argentinans were all so late to the game, compared to Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. They weren't stupid, they just didn't have as much foot traffic, outside ideas didn't get to them, they were on their own. Even after ships were around, cultures far inland still had the same problem. A culture advances based on how much contact it has with others, that's a basic fact. That, and its ability to grow a food surplus and support a large population, but it's mostly about how many people pass through, how many new ideas they get.


That's why, in researching cultures and history, I'll mostly just cover those two areas, Mesoamerica and Mesopotamia. Not to say other cultures have nothing to offer, but if your goal is syncretism of ideas, these two areas have been there, done that, and produced the best, most time-tested result. Cultures to the edges will only ever have a fraction of what the cultures in the center do, and while they may have a cool spin on the material, this book would be entirely too damn long if I included every single culture that ever existed. If your favorite part of the world wanted to be in this book, maybe it should have been more assertive during the tectonic shifts and grabbed a better spot, that's not my problem.
