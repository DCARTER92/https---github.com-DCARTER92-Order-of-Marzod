Have you checked on white supremacists lately? If you haven't, you'd be amazed at how they've changed. They don't talk about superiority anymore, or how other races are scum, they're 100% invested in how hard it is to be white. Apparently it's a great struggle every day, fighting the good fight against a world that hates them, and most of the political Right buys into this idea. They're being pushed out of society, apparently, and next thing you know they'll be shot in the streets by squads of government goons.

And they're not totally off base. If you go on social media, you'll see racism against white people being accepted, even celebrated, while any dissenters get dogpiled. You go to the wrong parts of the city as a white person, you get the evil eye from everybody you pass. In the current Western culture, racism against white people gets excused, while racism coming from a white person is the worst possible evil. White people still hold systemic power, but social power has turned against them hard in a lot of areas. And as social creatures, it's definitely distressing when society hates us, so it's not so much that the complaints of the Right have no basis, it's more that they're overblowing it, trying to turn it into a tangible, measurable problem that just doesn't exist. That's the divide between social power and systemic power, only one of them can actually ruin you.

See, they saw the Left get all riled up about identity politics, and somehow, every group other than straight white men are oppressed and important, and the Right said "hang on, where's ours?" And, understandably, they got upset that a significant chunk of society hated them all of a sudden, so they copied the playbook, started playing "we're not oppressors, we're oppressed!" They stole the strategy without thinking through how dumb that was going to look. You can't claim you, as a straight white man, are oppressed when you're living in a mostly straight, white, male system and expect that to fly. You can say you're unpopular due to the actions of your ancestors, and that's not fair because none of them asked your opinion before they did bad things. You can definitely make a case that you're hated for no good reason, and that this isn't balancing the scales so much as creating a new offense. You can say you're upset that people hate you through no fault of your own, that's a valid stance, you just can't pretend anything bigger comes of it.

Not that I'm on the Left's side either, I hate the game, not which team plays it. They talk about how all the rich people in this country are white, and look, I want you to know, as a straight white man who grew up poor as hell, that Musk has never given me gas money. Bezos never bought me a beer. Gates doesn't help me out when there's too much month left at the end of the money. I don't know who told you they were doing that, or what benefit you think white men are getting, but the ones in power aren't sharing with us at Straight White Male Club meetings.

Now, I know you Leftists are about to bring up how black people are still currently being oppressed in the Western world, and the U.S. in particular. I'll admit that it looks true, and even is true, but not on as large a scale as you think. Poor people are being oppressed, and black people are overrepresented among the poor because of past, not current, oppression. While poor black people get arrested and imprisoned a little bit more often than poor white people, the arrest and conviction rates of poor white people are still higher than the rates for middle class black people. So hey, good news to everyone on all sides that likes whining about how oppressed they are, you can still complain, you just need to complain about the right thing. Stop being Team White, Team Black, Team Gay, and be Team Not-Billionaire, because trust me, this team is the only one that needs to win, fighting with your teammates is counterproductive for all of us.

Income is the single biggest determining factor in how oppressed you are, and there is no close second to this behemoth. The only oppressors that matter are the billionaires, they manipulate the media to keep us fighting over crumbs while they eat the meal. We get oppression stories sold to us, there's always some new group who needs recognition, and in the end everybody has a reason to accept their station in life. It is what it is, I'm oppressed, there's no hope, why bother trying? Meanwhile we're fed a new Boogeyman every time we start getting bored with the old one, and we're saturated with entertainment and greasy, salty, fatty food so we never get pissed off enough to do anything. Bread and circuses, right? We're living without hope for the future, but we're fed, we're entertained, and we have a strawman to blame, so we keep working like good little cogs in the machine.

And if you think the solution is to vote harder, get the right mascot in the right office, I'm sorry to tell you that won't work. Most democratic societies are set up as perpetual gridlock. Even if they wanted to, no politician could make a change that his peers couldn't block or the next guy couldn't undo. They all have to pull together to do anything, and that pressure will not come from below. We're too fragmented, we have all these arbitrary lines drawn between us, most prominently Right versus Left, and so the only unified political pressure comes from up the chain, the billionaires, not down here where we live.

Now, of course, I'm not the first person to think we're all trapped by the elites. But did you ever notice how many people say there's a problem, then immediately tell you what you need to buy from them to make things better? Most escape hatches aren't escape hatches at all, they just want to turn you into a specific type of consumer, whether it's prepper, gun nut, eco-conscious, spiritualist, stock gambling, crypto, they tell you the world is a terrible place and you can escape it, but somehow the escape always involves buying something, usually for twice what it cost to produce. Gotta support the cause, right? They're just a small business who believes in doing what's right, don't you want to help them? That's why I'm going to tell you how to not be livestock for the rich, and it won't cost you a penny.

There's only one step: Reduce spending. Look at all the things you spend money on, and ask "what can I do without? What can I find a workaround for?" The need for money is your leash, and every time you choose comfort and convenience, you tighten it yourself. Ruthlessly cut everything you can, because dependence is slavery. If you have to be a little less comfortable to be free, isn't it worth it? Do you honestly like working every second of your life just to be allowed to exist?

It's not even that hard to do. You don't need Netflix, find something to do with your time that you'll care about rather than passively waiting for your free time to end. You don't need a $1,000 phone, let me tell you, you'll never notice the difference if you get a $200 phone. The only reason you need a new car is if the old one doesn't run, and everyone in your house doesn't need their own. You don't need fast food, pretty much ever, take 30 minutes and cook. Now that you ditched Netflix you've got lots of time.

You can go much bigger with this idea if you want to. You can build a self-sustaining farm on your property, and if you can't get property, you'd probably be shocked at how many off-grid communes there are around you already. Even low acreage can sustain you if you focus on cash and barter crops, or you can embrace the van life, live in a van and do odd jobs for grocery money. The point is, the system is built for livestock, and if you don't like being livestock, you have to live outside the system. It takes some work and ingenuity, but it's possible, and pulling out of the system is the only way to hurt the ones running it. If you think you'll get things changed by voting for the right mascot, ha, good luck, it's the same people running both sides. You can't win a rigged game by playing harder, you win by walking away and making your own game.

The truth is, nobody's going to change things. The time for that has passed, the parasites have their hooks in. Democratic government is intentionally designed for a constant stalemate, the only change that happens comes from both sides. And I guarantee you the rich are pulling both sides harder than all the rest of us could, even if we did manage to put aside our petty squabbles. The only way to break the game is if enough of us don't play. You don't need more stuff. You need less leash, and a life you don't have to beg to keep.
