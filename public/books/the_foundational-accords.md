# The Foundational Accords

Part I: The Foundation

I: The First Accord

In the beginning, the Order established the first Accord, a pact of unity and purpose. This Accord set forth the principles that would guide all future generations.

II: The Pillars

The Accords are built upon the pillars of wisdom, compassion, and strength. Each pillar supports the Order in times of trial.
